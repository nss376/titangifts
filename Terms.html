									<h3 class="major">Introduction and Agreement</h3>
									<p>This website (“Site”) is owned by Titan Sounds (Pty) Limited t/a Titan Gifts (“the Company” / “us” / “we”). (Registration number: 2015/079889/07) The Site promotes the sale of the Company’s products as well as other products (collectively “the Products”).</p>

									<p>By shopping or browsing on this Site, you:</p>
									<p>Represent and warrant that you have read and understood these terms and conditions as well as the policies displayed on this Site; and agree to be bound by these terms and conditions as well as the policies (collectively “the Agreement”).</p>

									<h3 class="major">PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SITE IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THIS AGREEMENT.</h3>
									
									<h3>Product Pricing and Availability</h3>
									<p>The Products displayed on this Site are subject to availability. The Company reserves the right, without prior notice, to discontinue or change pricing or specifications on Products and services offered on this Site without incurring any liability whatsoever.</p>
									<h4>Colours</h4>
									<p>Titan Sounds has made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colours of the Products that appear on the Site. As the actual colours you see will depend on your computer’s monitor we cannot guarantee, however, that your monitor’s display of any colour will be accurate.</p>	
									<h4>Artwork</h4>
									<p>The Company endeavours to match your artwork as closely as possible. However, in the event that specific printing is required, the Client is to note the following:
										All artwork needs to be print ready.  Should the artwork not be print ready, the Company will charge an editing fee.
									   The artwork must be supplied in the following formats:
									   Photographic Images: High resolution JPEG Format
									   Vector Images may be used for vinyl prints.
									   Word files only as layout samples:  please send artworks separately as accepted file format.
										Artwork should have a resolution of at least 300dpi.  Should the artwork be lower than that, pixels might be noticeable, although it will still be printable.  The Company endeavours to make the artwork look as good as possible.</p>
									<h4>Payment</h4>
									<p>Products bought via EFT will only be delivered to you once your payment has cleared in the Company’s bank account and is reflected as a payment on the Company’s bank statement within 3 working days of date of the placement of your order.
										A transaction may be refused if the Company is not satisfied that it is legitimate.</p>
									<h4>Stock Availability</h4>
									<p>The Company cannot always guarantee the availability of stock. If we are unable to supply each and every product ordered or in the quantities ordered, you nevertheless agree to accept delivery and make payment for the items correctly delivered. Stocks of all goods on offer are limited. The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to discontinue the offer as soon as stock is no longer available.
										Under no circumstances will the Company be liable to you for failing to supply Products ordered by you if the shortage of stock or capacity is due to circumstances beyond the Company’s control. In such circumstances, the Company will take reasonable steps to inform you of the shortage of stock or capacity as soon as it is practicable to do so.</p>	
									<h4>Confirmation of Orders</h4>
									<p>Your offer to purchase Products subject to this Agreement. Your offer is deemed to have been accepted by the Company when your payment reflects on the Company’s bank statement in the case of payment via EFT. Failure by the Company to formally confirm or notify acceptance shall not affect the validity of the sale or the enforce-ability thereof.
										On bulk orders, work will only commence once 50% payment of the order is received.  The remaining 50% including delivery/shipping fee (if applicable) will be payable before dispatch of goods.
										Work will only commence once the Client has accepted the estimate as well as the Company’s Terms & Conditions as well as design sign off.</p>
									<h4>Risk and Ownership</h4>
									<p>Risk in the Products shall pass to you upon delivery of the Products at the delivery address chosen by you. Until payment is received in full for any goods sold, ownership in the Products shall remain with the Company and such Products shall be returned and/or surrendered to the Company following receipt of a default notice from the Company.</p>
									<h4>Agreement of Sale</h4>
									<p>An agreement of sale in respect of a Product between the Company and you only comes into effect when the Company from the issuing bank receives a Credit Card authorisation or when the Company’s bank statement reflects your payment via EFT, and the order has been invoiced. The Company reserves the right to:
										Refuse to accept and/or execute an order without giving any reasons, and
										Cancel orders in whole or in part in its sole and absolute discretion.
										The Company shall only be liable to refund monies already paid by the user. A delivery fee will be charged each time Products are delivered to you</p>	
									<h4>Replacement Products and Refunds</h4>
									<p>Should the Company supply the incorrect Product or if the Product supplied is damaged, the Client shall notify the Company within 24 hours of receiving the goods. Errors and omissions will not be corrected if the Company is not informed within the required 24 hours of receipt of the product. The Company shall exchange the Product for a new one, proved that the damaged or incorrect unit is returned in its original packaging within 10 days days of the delivery of the Product to you. Cash refunds will not be given. The Company will replace any damaged or incorrect Product with a new Product within a reasonable amount of time. In the case of refunds, any monies due to you will be paid back into the bank account from which payment was received from you. Any garment to be returned for replacement should not be have been washed or worn. </p>
